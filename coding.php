		<h1>Learning to Code: My Journey</h1>
			<p>At the start of 2013, I made the decision to learn how to write code. After being laid-off from a startup in which I was unable to contribute any code or move the product forward from a technical standpoint, I decided it was time to start my journey.
			</p>
			<p>After doing some light reading, I realized that I wanted to learn both front-end and back-end code. I didn't want to just style a page. I wanted to learn how to build interactive web apps. Over the last few years I've been building massive Excel sheets with complicated formulas. If I can do that, I can do this.
			</p>
			<p>I've always been curious enough to learn new technologies, but this was a hurdle I didn't think I could clear. I thought that because I never knew what was possible. I had no idea where to begin, how to learn and what I was trying to accomplish. However, little by little I've moved the ball down the field. I don't know how far I can go, but so far so good.

			<h3>My Invaluable Learning Roadmap:</h3>
				<a href="http://prework.flatironschool.com/web-development/">Flatiron School Prework</a>
				<p>I want to take a second to acknowledge just how important the Flatiron School Prework has been to my learning. This document has been my guide in terms of which technology to learn and when. When starting out, everything is intimadating. You don't know where to start and where to find answers. This guide shows you the hurdles on the course and gives you resources needed to clear them. It's up to you to jump, but having this roadmap has been a lifesaver. Anyone have $12k so I can join one of their development programs?

			<h3>Languages I've Learned:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="learned_list">Command Line:</span> Enough to navigate, not an expert.</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">Git:</span> Can use Github, understand branches and merges. Need more experience, have never worked in a team setting.</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">HTML:</span> Very comfortable. Can code pages and elements fairly quickly. Use HTML5, more to come with experience</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">CSS:</span> Very comfortable. Not a design expert but enough to get the job done. Could still learn more about positioning. Don't use CSS3 transitions yet. Should learn more bootstrap to speed up development.</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">Sass:</span> Understand it and found it awesome. Just need to use it more. Certainly a better way to work in CSS, just need to switch over permanently.</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">Javascript/jQuery:</span> Sigh. Overwhelmed me at first. Now that I have programing concepts down, should get easier. Need to dive back in.</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">SQL/Databases:</span> Have a solid foundation. Can write simple SQL statements and navigate okay. Not many great learning resources online, could use some peer training. Haven't learned the differences between the different types.</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">Ruby:</span> I've really enjoyed learning this and it excites me. I have built a strong foundation, need more experience in the advanced stuff. I've read multiple books and sites, but get stuck once it gets too complicated. Need in-person training.</li>
				<li><span class="learned_list">Rails:</span> Sigh, again. This has been a real struggle. I haven't had my breakthrough moment yet. I'm starting to understand MVC, but it feels unnatural so far. I've followed guides and put stuff on the server using scaffolding, but I'm not really learning. Just following directions. I've read many feel lost learning this and I'm certainly in that stage. Need in-person training for this one.
